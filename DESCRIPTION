Description: sintillate provides tools for quantifying trade-offs between two measured variables.
    This might be the effect of a gene on two distinct phenotypes, the same phenotypes measured in separate environments.
    This is done by converting measurements on two variables into angles and vector lengths.
    The angle is informative about the direction of the pleiotropic effects, and the length about the overall magnitude of the effect.
