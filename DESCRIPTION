Description: sintillate provides tools for quantifying trade-offs between two measured variables.
    This might be the effect of a gene on two distinct phenotypes, the same phenotypes measured in separate environments.
    Effects are quantified through the statistic $\tau$, describing the extent to 
    which an effect on one trait is associated with an increase, decrease or no
    effect on the second trait, and $q$ describing how likely it is that $\tau$
    is generated by chance alone.
