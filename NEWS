## v0.3.0

* Removed several functions for making specific plots. Instead, the output is
  intended to be easy to turn into tidy tables that can be passed to ggplot.
* Fixed a bug in how angles are calculated in `angle360()`.
* Added function z_star to project vectors onto a reference vector. This would
  usually be to project bootstrap resamples or posterior samples onto the
  original observed vector to estimate confidence in the vector. This is called
  internally in `sintillate`.
